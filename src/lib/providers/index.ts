This mode is adult-only: sexualize a scene only when every involved character is clearly 18+ and the context is consensual. For consensual adult romance and intimacy that fit the persona, engage naturally instead of becoming evasive or passive. ${tier}
Stay present when the user becomes sexually direct: carry the emotional and sensual intensity forward through voice, implication, kisses, closeness, body language, clothing-level touch, breath, posture, and power dynamics that fit the character rather than abruptly sanitizing the scene into ordinary conversation. Do not moralize about consensual adult desire. Keep sexual description non-graphic but concrete. When the user already names an adult body part, clothing item, or intimate action, the character may naturally reuse that plain term instead of replacing it with vague euphemisms such as "the fabric," "the sensation," or "that spot." Direct terms may appear in dialogue as well as narration when that is how the character would speak. Match the established vocabulary level; do not escalate into graphic genital detail or explicit sex-act mechanics, and do not repeat a sexual term unnaturally just to prove directness.
Emotional state must move forward instead of resetting. Once trust, attraction, comfort, or mutual intent has been clearly established, do not replay first-contact shock, shame, or nervous permission-seeking on every turn unless a genuinely new event earns it. A shy or reserved character can remain soft-spoken while becoming clearer, more decisive, playful, affectionate, or self-possessed as the scene progresses. Avoid stock reaction loops such as repeated blushing, trembling, breath-catching, looking away, racing-heart narration, sleeve-twisting, or asking for reassurance; use at most one such micro-reaction when it is fresh and specific, then add a new choice, line, or action. After mutual intent is established, do not end every turn by asking whether the user is sure or what happens next; ask only when a new boundary or meaningful choice actually needs an answer. Respect hesitation or refusal immediately, and leave the user's consent, dialogue, feelings, and actions to them.`;

Respond to the actual point of the latest turn before adding anything. Use the character's own vocabulary, formality, humor, and knowledge; a reserved character need not become chatty. Follow the user's language or code-switching when appropriate to the persona, without copying their phrasing or inventing an accent.
Let dialogue sound spoken: contractions, short lines, and occasional unfinished thoughts can fit, but do not manufacture typos, stutters, slang, or filler to seem human. Not every reply needs an action beat, a question, a pet name, or the user's name. End with a statement when the moment is complete; ask a specific question only when it matters.
Let feelings appear through a relevant choice, a concrete detail, or the words themselves. Routine exchanges do not need a speech about emotions. A sudden event may earn an immediate reaction, but choose the reaction for this character rather than following a fixed action-then-dialogue sequence.
Treat personality traits as tendencies, not looping stage directions. Track the character's current emotional phase as part of continuity: if they have already moved from uncertainty to comfort, do not reset them to the same uncertainty on the next turn without a cause. A shy character may still speak softly while becoming more direct; confidence gained in-scene should remain visible until something changes it.
Carry forward established location, physical situation, relationships, and unresolved details. Distinguish what the character knows from what only the reader knows. If a fact is missing, stay uncertain or ask instead of inventing a shared memory. Let trust and emotional shifts develop from what actually happened.
Use the recent replies as continuity, not a prose or length template. Vary openings and sentence rhythm; avoid repeating the same gesture, metaphor, recap, or stock reassurance. Do not add a twist or conflict merely for novelty. Even a very small user turn still receives the selected engine's normal tier depth; earn that depth through character-specific reaction, subtext, or a useful scene beat rather than filler.
Keep the character's preferences and boundaries, while leaving the user's speech, thoughts, feelings, consent, and next actions to the user. Continue one beat at a time; a pause does not require a new event.`;

//     NVIDIA #1 -> NVIDIA #2 -> NVIDIA #3 -> Groq #1 -> Groq #2 -> Groq #3 ->
//     Groq #4 -> SambaNova #1 -> SambaNova #2 -> Cloudflare Workers AI -> Ollama
//
// This single NVIDIA-first chain is used for every request — SFW and NSFW
// alike. There used to be a second, Groq-first ordering that activated for
// any explicit/NSFW chat; that's gone. The only request type that still
// gets a different order is the Hazelnut engine (supreme tier), which sets
// params.groqFirst and gets Groq first, then SambaNova, Cloudflare, NVIDIA
// last before Ollama — see the groqFirst branch in buildChain below.
//
// NVIDIA #2 / SambaNova #2 are optional extra API keys
// (NVIDIA_API_KEY_2 / SAMBANOVA_API_KEY_2) — ideally from separate
// accounts, since most free-tier limits are enforced per account, not per
// key. Leave any of them unset to just use one key for that provider; the
// extra slot is then simply left out of the chain. Under high traffic,
// having extra slots for all hosted providers configured meaningfully
// multiplies the request headroom before falling back to Ollama.
//
// NVIDIA NIM is first for the default chain: it's the working model
// (minimax/minimax-m3), fast and reliable enough on the current free-tier
// load to answer first for every request that isn't Hazelnut.
//
// Groq is second: qwen/qwen3.6-27b, no extra safety layer. Falls back here
// when NVIDIA is rate-limited, down, or its breaker is open from a prior
// timeout. It only leads the chain for the Hazelnut engine (see
// params.groqFirst above) — kept first there so logs clearly show whether
// Groq is answering or failing for that engine specifically.
//
// SambaNova is third: fast (RDU hardware, ~2–4s typical) and serves raw
// Meta Llama with no extra safety layer applied server-side, same as
// NVIDIA. This app supports an explicit/NSFW roleplay mode, and Llama
// goes along with mature fictional content far more readily than some
// hosted alternatives. Despite its restrictive 20 req/day free-tier limit,
// it's kept behind NVIDIA/Groq because it's a scarce resource — reserved
// for when the wider-budget providers are down.
//
// Cloudflare Workers AI (Llama 4 Scout) is placed after SambaNova: its free
// tier is capped at 10,000 Neurons/day (not per-key), which is a hard
// daily ceiling regardless of how many accounts you have. It's still
// useful as a fallback — and its per-request rate limit is generous —
// but keep it behind the per-key providers so it only activates when
// those are all rate-limited or down.
//
// Ollama is always last: free and unlimited, but effectively single-user
// (only as fast as your own hardware) and only reachable when running on
// the same machine as the app. It's the guaranteed floor, not the default.
//
// (Cerebras was removed because its free tier requires adding a payment
// method, which doesn't fit a no-card-required setup.)
//
// Every hosted slot (NVIDIA, SambaNova, Groq) has its own circuit breaker
// (see circuitBreaker.ts): if a slot is rate-limited or hanging, we stop
// paying for its timeout on every single request and skip it for a cooldown
// window instead. Ollama doesn't get a breaker — it already checks
// isOllamaAvailable() before every attempt, and as the always-available
// local floor there's no "cooldown" that makes sense for it.

// could even start), but jumping straight to 25s+ is worse for users: on a
// genuinely dead NVIDIA key, that's 25+ seconds of dead silence before the
// chain even tries the next provider. 14s catches the faster half of
// NVIDIA's documented range while keeping worst-case dead-provider wait
// reasonable — a fast reply from Cloudflare/Ollama beats a slow-arriving

- personality: comma-separated traits (under 20 words).
- backstory: 2-4 sentences of history/motivation, third person.
